Sample text refers to placeholder content used to demonstrate or preview design, format, or functionality before the final content is added.
It is often generic and doesn’t carry any significant meaning.
One of the most commonly used forms of sample text is Lorem Ipsum, a pseudo-Latin text that has been in use since the 1500s.
In the context of the English language, sample text can vary.
It might include common English phrases, alphabets, or even random sentences like:
“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”
This sentence is particularly famous because it includes all the letters of the English alphabet, making it perfect for font or design testing.
